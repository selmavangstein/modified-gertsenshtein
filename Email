Dear Selma,

Well done on what looks like a successful integration of the GR equations. I
think we can divide this project into two portions: (i) the algebraic pipeline,
which you completed over the summer, and (ii) the numerical pipeline.

I suggested towards the end of next week for you to revisit the algebraic
pipeline so that we can be sure of where our equations are coming from, but I
now think it would be more efficient if I did that myself. After all, the
consolidation of the sources and the HPC integration was done from my side.

Instead, I'd suggest you spend this week on the numerics, continuing to use the
GR equations as an example. The functionality we want is as follows;

#=========================#
#  Scales and dimensions  #
#=========================#

We should 

astrophysics
Tens to hundred of Hz with strains of 1e-21

cavities in the GHz range

#===============================#
#  Standard initial conditions  #
#===============================#

We should retain the freedom to define arbitrary profiles in the initial
`u`-slices, but we do probably want to follow the literature and focus on
high-frequency sinusoids, without support. As a start, we can transfer all the
dimensionality to the low-frequency factors and use unit-sinusoids for the
high-frequency parts. The high-frequency parts will then be parameterised by:

- Frequency `f` representative of GWs, we assume the EM frequency is the same.
- Completely general phase shift `phi` between the GW and EM parts.

Once these parameters are specified, we still need to provide initial data for
the low-frequency parts. We expect there to be a phase shift between the GW and
EM parts in the `v` direction, but we only know what this phase shift will be
in the case of the GR solution which, up to some approximations, is analytic.
It therefore makes sense to consider:

- For the metric, zero derivative and an amplitude `h` which is given by some
  fiducial strain representative of GWs.
- For the magnetic field perturbation, completely general amplitude `b` and
  derivative `db` within some range of values that isn't utterly absurd (for
example, with energy densities not exceeding those that might be found in a
microwave oven, if you multiply the square of the derivative by the square of
the amplitude and include the appropriate fictional SI constants).

We also need to specify the background field:

- For the background magnetic field `B`, some fiducial value representative of
  laboratory magnetic fields.

#============================#
#  Testing of a given model  #
#============================#

Perform the integration over a square of spacetime with side-length `l`,
starting at an integer number `N` of evenly-spaced points in the initial
`u`-slice and propagating each point across the square in the `v` direction.
