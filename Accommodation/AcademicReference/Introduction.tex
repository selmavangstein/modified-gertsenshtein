I am writing to strongly recommend \textbf{Nicky Ross} in his application for Ph.D. positions. I am a fully independent research fellow at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge. Since 2017 I have supervised over one hundred physics students in small group teaching sessions, run three summer internships, and completed Masterâ€™s research projects for eight mathematics and physics students (a further five projects ongoing this year) while co-supervising two Ph.D. students.
