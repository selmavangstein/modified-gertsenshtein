\paragraph{Commitment to diversity} Within the last year, the responsibility of research supervision has overturned my understanding of the challenges and opportunities which accompany \emph{neurodiversity} (specifically ADHD, severe OCD and dyslexia). I take pride in the personal/professional accommodations I made and the successful research and well-being outcomes. I also take pride in having selected and supervised two out of two non-male applicants in a field with a harmful \emph{gender} imbalance; a record which I hope to preserve. I acknowledge my own position of socioeconomic, class and able-bodied privilege (among other forms), which leads many other aspects of diversity, equity and inclusion to remain invisible to me. Therefore, I commit to continually seeking and heeding advice from involved professionals, colleagues and students. I will both participate in larger pro-diversity initiatives, and continue to adopt micro-practices such as driving gender/demographic parity amongst citations and invited speakers.
